## Project Description
Gala Groceries is a technology-led grocery store chain based in the USA. They rely heavily on new technologies, such as IoT to give them a competitive edge over other grocery stores. 

They pride themselves on providing the best quality, fresh produce from locally sourced suppliers. However, this comes with many challenges to consistently deliver on this objective year-round.

Gala Groceries approached Cognizant to help them with a supply chain issue. Groceries are highly perishable items. If you overstock, you are wasting money on excessive storage and waste, but if you understock, then you risk losing customers. They want to know how to better stock the items that they sell.

### Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) - Task 1
- The task is to run EDA on a sample dataset and deliver insights to the data science manager through email.

### Data Modeling - Task 2
- To carry out such a strategy plan. To assist with this work, the data engineering team has given some extra resources.
Once the modelling is completed, Need to summarise results on a single business-friendly PowerPoint slide

### Model Building and Interpretation - Task 3
- Now, using the data, build a prediction model and summarise the results on a powerpoint deck.

### Machine Learning Production - Task 4
- Provide baseline model code to ML Engineering Team, So that they will review the code and biuild their production pipeline for deployment.

### Quality Assurance - Task 5
- Following the completion of the testing, the DevOps team will address some questions regarding the algorithm in order to further optimise the model before integrating it with Gala Groceries' live system.
